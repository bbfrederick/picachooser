PICAchooser (the package)
=========================

   :alt: Logo

A set of simple gui tools for scanning through MELODIC probabilistic ICA
runs and quickly making decisions about which components to retain, and
what relates to what. These tools each only do one thing, but they do them
quickly and easily using only keyboard input. Current programs are
PICAchooser, melodicomp, and grader.

Full documentation is here: https://picachooser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html

What's in here?
===============

PICAchooser
-----------
Lets you step through the components in an ICA analysis (from many sources), and select which components you
want to retain.  In addition to showing the spatial ICs, it also displays the component timecourses,
motion traces, and the correlation between them, to help with your decision making.

Once you launch, you do everything with keyboard commands, and it's been optimized to go as fast as possible, so
you aren't waiting around for things.

melodicomp
----------
Puts up two melodic IC files side by side.  In order to make the comparison meaningful, it first calculates the
spatial crosscorrelation between each IC in the first file and each IC in the second.  As you step through components
in the first file, on the right you see the component with the highest crosscorrelation in the second file.  You can
sort either by IC order in the first file (i.e. in order of descending variance explained), or in descending
correlation coefficient (i.e. best matched components first). When you quit (or hit the escape key), it writes out
a file listing the best matched ICs along with their correlation coefficients.

I'm especially proud of the "blink" feature.  When you hit the "b" key, the right and left window swap,
instantaneously.  This lets you see what changes between the two sets of networks in a very natural way.  This
is inspired by blink comparators, a cool old piece of tech probably long forgotten by most.

Again, once you launch, you do everything with keyboard commands, and it's been optimized to go as fast as
possible, so you aren't waiting around for things.

A note on component numbering
=============================
Astute users will notice that components are numbered differently in different contexts.  This is actually intentional.
In the GUI, and in any files that work directly with FSL tools, I use whatever convention FSL uses.  So for displayed
components, the first component is IC1.  Output files that will be used by fsl_regfilt also use this convention.  However,
for any informational output on the terminal that you might use when looking at components in FSLeyes directly, or operating
on them with fslmaths or your own python code, the component numbering starts at 0.  As the universe intended.  If you use matlab,
add 1 in your head.  Better yet, stop using matlab and change over to python.
